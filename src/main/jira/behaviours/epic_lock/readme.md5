Issue Type is Epic. Custom field - Checkbox type, name = "LockedForChange", Values = Yes\None (empty).
“LockedForChange” can be set to “Yes” during specific transition via transition screen.

### When “LockedForChange” = “Yes” for Epic ###:
- disable inline editing (all fields except Comments) in Epic and linked issue of FR issue type only;
- disable adding links and adding Epic children;
### For linked issues of Issue Type FR, when the Epic has “LockedForChange” = “Yes" ###:
- disable editing of FR type issues that are linked to Locked Epic (“LockedForChange” = “Yes”).
### Scripts ###:
1. [Behaviours] DisableEditingBasedOnFieldVal.groovy disables editing for Epic/FR;
2. [Behaviours] HideLockIndicatorField.groovy hides “LockedForChange” field. SR does not allow hiding checkbox field with empty value, when the script is
   attached to the same field. Current script solves the problem. Can be attached to any visible field, for example "Summary".
3. [Listener] jira/listeners/copy/SelectListValFromEpicToIssuesInEpic.groovy copies LockedForChange field val from Epic to linked FR issues
   in order to make DisableEditingBasedOnFieldVal.groovy script actual for linked FR issues too;
4. [Behaviours] LimitLinkingToEpicFromChildBasedOnEpicFieldVal.groovy does not allow linking to locked Epic;
5. [Fragments] jira/fragments/HideUiElementsBasedOnFieldValue.groovy for hiding UI elements in Epic.
